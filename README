PROGRAM ISSUES/USE
Before completing certain tasks (i.e changing an elevator weight, or sending a powerout signal to an elevator), you have to make sure that the "user is in the elevator", i.e a up/down request was intiated, as otherwise the signal won't be sent to the current elevator, as there's no current elevator being used.
